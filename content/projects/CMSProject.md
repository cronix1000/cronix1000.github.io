title: Content Managment System
dateMonthYear: January 2023
description:      The content management system was a challenge given
        to us by our teacher. Where with some PHP knowlege
        we had to figure out how to create a CMS with added
        customisations, of which I added the ability to have
        themes. This website was created with PHP and used 
        many features of MySQL to make it work smoothly with
        accounts and public and private pages available. 
        Also, inlduded self built authorization and error handling.
