title: VR-Hack Georgian Hackathon Second Place Safety Sphere VR Training 
dateMonthYear: February 2023
description:     Safety sphere was a project submitted to the Georgian      VR-Hack Hackathon that me and my group participated in, in February. The theme we ahd picked was workplace training with VR and how we can intergrade them. This project was my first true test of persistance, determination and will in a coding aspect. This is because I had to learn VR programming and design and make a presentation within 20 hours with my group and present to 2 groups of judges. On the technical side we developed 3 modular environments for ladder safety, chainsaw safety and WHMIS all of which where interactable with a goal and fully scripted.All in all this was an amazing experience that enjoyed.
